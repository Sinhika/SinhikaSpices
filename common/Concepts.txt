Concepts
========
Sinhika's Spices started out to be about harvesting spices in the wild. 
I started out designing a mechanism to peel bark from logs to get cinnamon bark (sticks).
So what do you do with bark?

All barks - bundle up into blocks like wood, only more fragile
Junglewood - Cinnamon sticks
Birch - paper, canoes, birch beer
Spruce - extract pitch which can make torches
Oak - nothing special

Junglewood to be later replaced with cinnamon trees.
Be sure to notice other mods that have registered tool materials, 
and make bark spuds from other tool materials.
Other log types should each yield a bark, if found.

After bark, what then?

Nutmeg & mace -- a rare nut.
Peppercorn - fruit of a vine.
chili - fruit of the chili pepper
various herbs - bushes & grasses.
